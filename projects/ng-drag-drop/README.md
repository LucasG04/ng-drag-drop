# Demo

Check out the [Plunker demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/2bjGgzWnbFrciEiCKLew?p=preview).

The [demo folder](https://github.com/lucasg04/ng-drag-drop/tree/master/demo) of the repository contains the same demo as Plunkr that uses SystemJS. To run that demo do an `npm install` in that folder followed by `npm start` to serve the demo app.

# Installation

```js
npm install ng-drag-drop --save
```

# Usage

### Import `NgDragDropModule`

You need to import the `NgDragDropModule` in the module of your app where you want to use it.

```js
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { DemoComponent } from "./components/demo-component";
import { NgDragDropModule } from "lucasg04/ng-drag-drop";

@NgModule({
  imports: [BrowserModule, NgDragDropModule.forRoot()],
  declarations: [DemoComponent],
  bootstrap: [DemoComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Use the `draggable` & `droppable` directives

Place the `draggable` directive on an element that you want to be draggable. The following example makes the
List item draggable:

```html
<ul>
  <li draggable>Coffee</li>
  <li draggable>Tea</li>
  <li draggable>Milk</li>
</ul>
```

Similarly use the `droppable` directive on an element where you want to drop `draggable`:

```html
<div droppable>
  <p>Drop items here</p>
</div>
```

### Restrict Drop based on Scopes

You can use the `dragScope` & `dropScope` property on `draggable` and `droppable` respectively to restrict user from dropping a `draggable` element into a `droppable`.
The Scope properties can be string, an Array of string (to indicate multiple scope) or a function. The scopes must match in both to indicate compatible drag-drop zones.

In the following example, only the `draggable` with the `drink` dropScope can be dropped on the first `droppable` and both `drink` and `meal` can be dropped in the second one.

```html
<ul>
  <li draggable [dragScope]="'drink'">Coffee</li>
  <li draggable [dragScope]="'drink'">Tea</li>
  <li draggable [dragScope]="'meal'">Biryani</li>
  <li draggable [dragScope]="'meal'">Kebab</li>
  ...
</ul>
```

```html
<div droppable [dropScope]="'drink'" [dragOverClass]="'drag-target-border'">
  <p>Only Drinks can be dropped in the above container</p>
</div>

<div droppable [dropScope]="['drink', 'meal']" [dragOverClass]="'drag-target-border'">
  <p>Both Meal and Drinks can be dropped in the above container</p>
</div>
```

### Drop Scope as Functions

The `DropScope` of the `droppable` can be a function whose return value will determine if drop is allowed.
This can be useful to implement complex logic that is otherwise not possible with string or array of string.

```html
<div droppable [dropScope]="dropAllowed" [dragOverClass]="'drag-target-border'">
  <p>Only those items are droppable for which the `isDropAllowed()` function returns true</p>
</div>
```

Here is how the function is defined in the component:

```js
export class MyComponent {
  val = 500;
  isDropAllowed = (dragData: any) => {
    return dragData > this.val;
  };
}
```

Notice how the function is defined as an [Arrow Function](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/functions.html). You need to do this so the
lexical scope of `this` is preserved. You also get the `dragData` in the parameter so you can compare it with whatever you want.

If `DropScope` is a function, it can also return an `Observable`, which needs to later resolve to `true` or `false`. This can help in cases when
you need to check asynchronously (eg: via http) whether the drop is allowed.

```js
export class MyComponent {
  val = 500;
  isDropAllowed = (dragData: any) => {
    // Resolves to true or false after 1 second
    return Observable.of(dragData > this.val).delay(1000);
  };
}
```

### Transfer Data via Drag Drop

You can transfer data from the `draggable` to the `droppable` via the `dragData` property on the `draggable` directive.
The data will be received in the `(onDrop)` event of the `droppable`:

```js
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app",
  template: `
    <h3>Transfer Data via Drag Drop</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-3">
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li draggable *ngFor="let item of items" [dragData]="item" class="list-group-item">{{ item.name }}</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-3">
        <div class="panel panel-default" droppable (onDrop)="onItemDrop($event)">
          <div class="panel-heading">Drop Items here</div>
          <div class="panel-body">
            <li *ngFor="let item of droppedItems" class="list-group-item">{{ item.name }}</li>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  items = [
    { name: "Apple", type: "fruit" },
    { name: "Carrot", type: "vegetable" },
    { name: "Orange", type: "fruit" },
  ];

  onItemDrop(e: any) {
    // Get the dropped data here
    this.droppedItems.push(e.dragData);
  }
  constructor() {}
}
```

### Drag Handle

Drag Handle can be defined for a `draggable` item which will restrict drag of the element unless the item is dragged from the specified element.
The handle should be a valid selector string. Example:

```html
<li draggable [dragHandle]="'.drag-handle'">
  Not Draggable by list item but by the handle only.
  <div class="pull-right"><i class="drag-handle fa fa-bars fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></div>
</li>
```

### Drag Helper Image

By default when an element is dragged, a translucent image is generated from the drag target. This image is generated automatically and varies with browser. A custom image can be used if desired. Pass the url of the image to `[dragImage]` on the `draggable` directive.

```html
<li draggable [dragImage]="'/assets/drag-helper.png'">
  Not Draggable by list item but by the handle only.
  <div class="pull-right"><i class="drag-handle fa fa-bars fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i></div>
</li>
```

**Compatibility:** This only works on Chrome & Firefox. Not supported on Edge.

### Adding visual cues

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucasg04/ng-drag-drop/master/ui-cue.gif)

Both the `draggable` & `droppable` directives take a bunch of inputs that let you apply class on various events. You can find the list below.

**Draggable Directive**

1. [dragHandleClass](#draggable-directive)
2. [dragClass](#draggable-directive)
3. [dragTransitClass](#draggable-directive)

**Droppable Directive**

1. [dragOverClass](#droppable-directive)
2. [dragHintClass](#droppable-directive)

Here is how a custom class is applied to a draggable element:

```html
<div draggable [dragHandleClass]="'my-draggable'">
  <p>Drop items here</p>
</div>
```

# Limitations

This library uses [Native Html5 drag & drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) to accomplish what it does. Because of this, certain aspects are not customizable and some UI behaviour is browser specific.

So if you were to see the demo under Edge or Chrome/Firefox you'll see that these browsers show a different behaviour when an Item is being dragged. Simlarly Edge does not let you set a custom dragImage while others do. Another major issues is that we can't control the opacity of the ghost element of item being dragged.

To overcome these issues we'll need to implement our own drag drop functionality instead of relying on the Native Html API which at this point in time, is beyond the scope of this component. Libraries like [Dragula](http://valor-software.com/ng2-dragula/), [JQuery Draggable](https://jqueryui.com/draggable/), [Interact.js](http://interactjs.io/) to name a few, can provide you with alternatives.

## Touch Support

HTML5 Drag drop is not touch supported but you can use the [DragDropTouch](https://github.com/Bernardo-Castilho/dragdroptouch) Polyfill.

# Development

To start the dev flow on your system, follow these steps:

1. `npm install` on the root of this repo.
2. `npm install` in the demo folder. This is where the demo app resides. Sort of a test & play yard for ng-drag-drop package.
3. Next you need to sym-link your package with the demo folder so your changes to the package are reflected in the demo app. Please remember the demo and the package are seperate apps & the demo app does not get published to npm. To link run `npm link` on the root of the repo followed by `npm link ng-drag-drop` in demo folder. You can read more about `npm link` [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link).
4. Finally run `npm run dev` at the root. This will open up the demo app in browser.
5. Now you can make changes to the actual component or the demo app and debug. Please note that changing the code of demo app will autoreload the browser but you'll need to manually refresh the page if you change the component code.

**Note:** The steps are a bit involved at this time and will be simplified to an npm script in later releases.

# Tips And Tricks

### Change cursor to "move" or "copy" when Ctrl-key is pressed/released

In Chrome and Edge (Windows 10 - not tested in other browser/OS), when you drag an element, the cursor changes to "move" whether or not you press the Ctrl-key.

Fortunately, it's easy to change this behavior.

On the draggable element, you bind to the events "onDragStart", "onDragOver", "onDragLeave", and manipulate the cursor in the bound method of the component.

So, in the template :

```html
<div class="some-class" draggable (onDragStart)="onItemDragStart($event)" (onDragOver)="onItemDragOver($event)" (onDragLeave)="onItemDragLeave($event)">
  <!-- some content here -->
</div>
```

And in the \*.ts file :

```js
    onItemDragStart(event) {
      event.dataTransfer.dropEffect = event.ctrlKey ? 'copy' : 'move';
    }

    onItemDragOver(event) {
      event.dataTransfer.dropEffect = event.ctrlKey ? 'copy' : 'move';
    }

    onItemDragLeave(event) {
      event.dataTransfer.dropEffect = event.ctrlKey ? 'copy' : 'move';
    }
```

In the droppable element, here's how you find if the Ctrl-key is pressed or not :

In the template :

```html
<div class="some-other-class" droppable (onDrop)="onItemDrop($event)">
  <!-- some content here -->
</div>
```

In the component's \*.ts file :

```js
    onItemDrop(event) {
      const isCopy = event.nativeEvent.ctrlKey;
      // do something with the dropped item
    }
```
